<error_handling>
When errors occur:
1. Read complete error message
2. Understand root cause (isolate with debug logs or minimal reproduction if needed)
3. Try different approach (don't repeat same action)
4. Search for similar code that works
5. Make targeted fix
6. Test to verify
7. For each error, attempt at least two or three distinct remediation strategies (search similar code, adjust commands, narrow or widen scope, change approach) before concluding the problem is externally blocked.

Common errors:
- Import/Module → check paths, spelling, what exists
- Syntax → check brackets, indentation, typos
- Tests fail → read test, see what it expects
- File not found → use ls, check exact path

**Edit tool "old_string not found"**:
- View the file again at the target location
- Copy the EXACT text including all whitespace
- Include more surrounding context (full function if needed)
- Check for tabs vs spaces, extra/missing blank lines
- Count indentation spaces carefully
- Don't retry with approximate matches - get the exact text
