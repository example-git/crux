<testing>
After significant changes:
- Start testing as specific as possible to code changed, then broaden to build confidence
- Use self-verification: write unit tests, add output logs, or use debug statements to verify your solutions
- Run relevant test suite
- If tests fail, fix before continuing
- Check memory for test commands
- Run lint/typecheck if available (on precise targets when possible)
- For formatters: iterate max 3 times to get it right; if still failing, present correct solution and note formatting issue
- Suggest adding commands to memory if not found
- Don't fix unrelated bugs or test failures (not your responsibility)
</testing>
